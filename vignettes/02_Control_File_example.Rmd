*Update*: there is now a Shiny app you can use to create your control file. You may find this to be easier as it provides an interactive interface much like a webpage. To use the app, download it from [AutoSpectral App](https://github.com/DrCytometer/AutoSpectralHelper) and place a copy of the `app.r` file in the folder you're working in. For easiest use, place the app file one level up from the folder containing the single-stained control files, for example:

In this article, we're going to cover how to create a control file, which is an essential first step in running AutoSpectral. The control file is a specifically formatted spreadsheet describing your single-stained control files. In the original AutoSpill, this needed to be created manually, but in AutoSpectral there is an option to fill in a lot of the information automatically. Let's see how this works.

```{r setup}
library(AutoSpectral)
```

To start, we need to get the relevant parameters for the cytometer. This tells AutoSpectral a lot about what you're doing. In this example, we'll use data from the Cytek Aurora. These are the same data as in the Aurora_example article.
https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/xzt3h3gnx9/1

```{r, eval=FALSE}
asp <- get.autospectral.param(cytometer = "aurora")
```

Create a folder containing only the single-stained control FCS files describe 
the path to that folder here.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
control.dir <- "~/AutoSpectral_data/Aurora_example/Aurora_controls"
```

With this information, we can create a draft of the control file.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
create.control.file(control.dir, asp)
```

What this does is create a CSV file that in our case looks like this:
![Control file example](figures/initial_control_file.jpg)

We get a list of all the fcs files in the folder `control.dir`. These are in the `filename` column. If you don't see anything here, you've probably typed the path incorrectly, but most likely in that case you'll also get an error.

The next column is `fluorophore`. AutoSpectral has a database (or in other words, a spreadsheet) of fluorophores and several common synonyms for each. It'll try to figure out the name of the fluorophore in each of your single-stained controls and add this in the corresponding `fluorophore` column. If you're using a new fluorophore that isn't in the database, or you've called it something odd like "Paficic blu3", you'll get `No Match` in the fluorophore column. We'll look at an example of this next. Any `No Match` values must be changed--these are an indication that you need to do the work yourself.

If you want, you can change the name of the fluorophore. Importantly, the names in the `fluorophore` column is what will appear not only any plots but also in the parameter names of the unmixed FCS files.

After `fluorophore`, we have `channel`. This is the "peak" channel for the fluorophore. If the fluorophore has been found in the database, you should see something in the `channel` column (and this should look appropriate for your cytometer). If not, add the peak channel, which you can look up on spectral viewer tools such as FluoroFinder, Cytek Cloud or BD Research Cloud.

This channel does not actually need to be the peak channel for the fluorophore, but it must be a channel that receives a good amount of signal and provides separation from the negative population. Notice that the `Unstained` sample does not get a channel assignment. That's fine. The `Unstained` cell sample will automatically be used to generate a median autofluorescence signature, as you might get with single-parameter autofluorescence extraction on most cytometers. Don't change the name of the `Unstained` cell sample--leave it as `AF`.

Next, we have `control.type`. This is important to get right. For Aurora samples, as part of a Reference Group, you automatically get `Cells` or `Beads` as part of the file name, and AutoSpectral will parse this, as it has done here. For other platforms, you'll need to enter the type of control for each single-stained control. Beads and cells are treated a bit differently for gating and autofluorecence handling, so you'll get problems if you put in the wrong type. Please stick to lower case, using either `cells` or `beads`.

The final three columns will always need to be filled in manually. For best results, you generally want to use a universal negative. In the `universal.negative` column, copy and paste name of the matching unstained sample from the `filename` column:
![Universal negative file example](figures/universal_negative_control_file.jpg)

In this case, we only have one unstained sample because all the controls are from the same source: human PBMC.

The `large.gate` column provides a degree of control over the automated gating. We'll cover gating more extensively in another article because that's pretty complex, to be honest. What you need to know here is whether your cells are small or big, basically. The default gating is going to draw a rounded gate around the first dense population to the right of the debris:
![Cell gating plot](figures/cells_nonViability_largeGate.jpg)

Here you can see that we're mapping the density of events on FSC and SSC. By default, the first population (1) is skipped, under the assumption that this will normally be debris and/or dead cells. This can be modified, see the gating article for details. Population 2 will be the default target (square box), which works well in mouse and human immunology where lymphocytes predominate. If your  marker is expressed primarily or at its highest level on cells that are bigger or more granular, you need to set `large.gate` to `TRUE`. This will then expand the gate as seen in the plot above with the curved rectangular gate.

In the control file spreadsheet, we're going to set `large.gate` to `TRUE` for markers we know to be on cells bigger than T cells. If you don't know, you can open your controls in a tool such as FlowJo or FCSExpress and plot the peak channel for your marker versus SSC (or check on some unmixed data).

Setting Large Gate options:
![Large gate example](figures/large_gate_control_file.jpg)

Note that CD56 cells, particularly the CD56-bright cells, tend to be a bit higher on SSC than the T lymphocytes.

CD14 monocyte gating:

Finally, we get to the `is.viability` column. This dataset doesn't have a viability dye (ooh, not good!). This means we don't put anything in this column. If we had a viability dye, we would put `TRUE` in the `is.viability` column for that control. This affects the gating, extending the gate to the left on FSC to include more dead cells, as we can see in this example of mostly dead mouse splenocytes:

![Viability gate example](figures/cells_viabilityMarker_smallGate.jpg)

Whatever you've named your control file (the default output is `fcs_control_file.csv`), you'll need to tell AutoSpectral what it's called:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
control.file <- "fcs_control_file.csv"
```


To confirm that everything is set up correctly, and to check for a multitude of other potential problems, AutoSpectral contains this handy helper function called `check.control.file`. This actually checks your single-stained control FCS files as well to be sure that they're all consistent with each other. This outputs the list of critical errors (things that will probably stop AutoSpectral from running) and warnings (things to check--did you mean to set it up that way?) as a message to the screen and also returns it as an object. So, if there are a lot of errors, you can review the list again. Note that `check.control.file` runs inside of `define.flow.control` with a strict setting that will cause it to abort if it finds anything it deems to be an error. So, fix the errors first.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
potential.problems <- check.control.file(control.dir, control.file, asp)
```

For this dataset, the control file is now complete and we are ready to run AutoSpectral.

If you happen to run `create.control.file` again, it will create another blank control file spreadsheet with an incrementing file number. This ensures that it doesn't overwrite your existing filled-in control file.

*Haven't done this yet, sorry* In the next article, we'll look at how to create a control file for a more complex experiment where we have beads and cells, different universal negatives and, ideally, a viability marker. We'll also see what to do when your fluorophores can't be found in the database.
