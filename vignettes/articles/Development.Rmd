Here's some stuff that's in progress. These changes will show up first in the development `dev` branch, which you are welcome to install and test.

I don't have a particular timeframe or priority list for any of this, so ping me if any of this is important to you.

* Parallelization improvements. 
  + The parallelization of functions like `define.flow.control` can be problematic on Windows due to memory usage with `futures` and the tendency of Windows to usurp threads that R was using.
* More flexibility in negative/unstained samples.
* Allow multiple controls per fluorophore.
* An alternative to the automated gating.
* Better handling of files from the Northern Lights (3-laser Aurora).
  --this is now in `dev` branch for testing
* Support for the A5 SE
  --this is now in `dev` branch for testing
* Better mapping of fluorophores to lasers in `spectral.trace`
  --this is now in `dev` branch for testing
* Some improvements/corrections to the weighting for WLS unmixing.
* Speed up per-cell fluorophore optimization.
* Fix the issue causing discontinuities


To install the `dev` branch:

```{r dev branch, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("DrCytometer/AutoSpectral@dev")
```

To replace this with the (hopefully) stable version, run this:

```{r master branch, eval=FALSE}
remove.packages("AutoSpectral")
devtools::install_github("DrCytometer/AutoSpectral")
```
