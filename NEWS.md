# AutoSpectral 0.9.0 (2025-12-07)

## New features
- Unmixing matrix can be saved via save.unmixing.matrix()
- Weights can be calculated via calculate.weights()
- Plotting of unmixing matrix in get.fluorophore.spectra

## Improvements
- More stable, faster parallel backend
- Changes to get.spectral.variants, including permanent fixing of previously 
user-modifiable parameters and low-level denoising of spectra.
- More checks in check.control.file.
- Faster AutoSpectral unmixing in base R.
- Adjustments to reduce any discontinuities produced during unmixing.
- See also updates in AutoSpectralRcpp, including a large speed up and general 
improvement to the Poisson IRLS unmixing.
- Changes to solve in unmix.ols and unmix.wls as suggested by SamGG.
- FCS files will now be written with "-A" in the channel names, e.g., "PE-A"
rather than just "PE".

## Bug fixes
- Bug patch for situations with beads using internal negatives in 
get.fluor.variants
- Patch to reload.flow.control bug affecting ID7000 samples.

- The Hotspot(TM) matrix will be calculated and plotted as per the pre-print by 
Peter Mage et al.

## Improvements
