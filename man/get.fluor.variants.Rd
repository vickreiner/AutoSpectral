\arguments{
\item{fluor}{The name of the fluorophore.}

\item{file.name}{A named vector of file names for the samples.}

\item{control.dir}{The directory containing the control files.}

\item{asp}{The AutoSpectral parameter list.}

\item{spectra}{A matrix containing the spectral data. Fluorophores in rows,
detectors in columns.}

\item{af.spectra}{Spectral signatures of autofluorescences, normalized
between 0 and 1, with fluorophores in rows and detectors in columns. Prepare
using \code{get.af.spectra}.}

\item{n.cells}{Numeric. Number of cells to use for defining the variation in
spectra. Up to \code{n.cells} cells will be selected as positive events in the peak
channel for each fluorophore, above the 99.5th percentile level in the
unstained sample.}

\item{som.dim}{Numeric. Number of x and y dimensions to use in the SOM for
clustering the spectral variation.}

\item{figures}{Logical, controls whether the variation in spectra for each
fluorophore is plotted in \code{output.dir}. Default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{output.dir}{File path to whether the figures and .rds data file will be
saved. Default is \code{NULL}, in which case \code{asp$variant.dir} will be used.}

\item{verbose}{Logical, default is \code{TRUE}. Set to \code{FALSE} to suppress messages.}

\item{spectral.channel}{A vector of spectral channels.}

\item{universal.negative}{A named vector of unstained negative samples, with
names corresponding to the fluorophores.}

\item{control.type}{Character, either "beads" or "cells". Determines the type
of control sample being used and the subsequent processing steps.}

\item{raw.thresholds}{A named vector of numerical values corresponding to
the threshold for positivity in each raw detector channel. Determined by the
99.5th percentile on the unstained sample, typically.}

\item{unmixed.thresholds}{A named vector of numerical values corresponding to
the threshold for positivity in each unmixed channel. Determined by the
99.5th percentile on the unstained sample, typically after single-cell AF
unmixing.}

\item{flow.channel}{A named vector of peak raw channels, one per fluorophore.}
}
\value{
A matrix with the flow expression data.

\description{
Assesses variation in the spectral signature of a single-stained flow
cytometry control sample. Uses SOM-based clustering on the brightest positive
events in the file.
