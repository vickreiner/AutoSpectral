\title{Get Spectral Variations for Fluorophores}
\usage{
get.spectral.variants(
  control.dir,
  control.def.file,
  asp,
  spectra,
  af.spectra,
  n.cells = 2000,
  som.dim = 7,
  figures = TRUE,
  output.dir = NULL,
  parallel = FALSE,
  verbose = TRUE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{control.dir}{File path to the single-stained control FCS files.}

\item{control.def.file}{CSV file defining the single-color control file names,
fluorophores they represent, marker names, peak channels, and gating requirements.}

\item{asp}{The AutoSpectral parameter list.
Prepare using \code{get.autospectral.param}}

\item{spectra}{A matrix containing the spectral data. Fluorophores in rows,
detectors in columns.}

\item{af.spectra}{Spectral signatures of autofluorescences, normalized
between 0 and 1, with fluorophores in rows and detectors in columns. Prepare
using \code{get.af.spectra}.}

\item{n.cells}{Numeric, default \code{2000}. Number of cells to use for defining
the variation in spectra. Up to \code{n.cells} cells will be selected as positive
events in the peak channel for each fluorophore, above the 99.5th percentile
level in the unstained sample.}

\item{som.dim}{Numeric, default \code{7}. Number of x and y dimensions to use in
the SOM for clustering the spectral variation. The number of spectra returned
for each fluorophore will increase with the quadratic of \code{som.dim}, so for 7,
you will get up to 49 variants. Increasing the SOM dimensions does not help.
Somewhere between 4 and 7 appears to be optimal.}

\item{figures}{Logical, controls whether the variation in spectra for each
fluorophore is plotted in \code{output.dir}. Default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{output.dir}{File path to whether the figures and .rds data file will be
saved. Default is \code{NULL}, in which case \code{asp$variant.dir} will be used.}

\item{parallel}{Logical, default is \code{FALSE}, in which case sequential processing
will be used. Parallel processing will likely be faster when many small
files are read in. If the data is larger, parallel processing may not
accelerate the process much or may fail outright.}

\item{verbose}{Logical, default is \code{TRUE}. Set to \code{FALSE} to suppress messages.}

\item{...}{Ignored. Previously used for deprecated arguments such as
\code{pos.quantile} and \code{sim.threshold}, which are now fixed internally and no
longer user-settable.}
}
\value{
A vector with the indexes of events inside the initial gate.

\description{
This function cycles through all the fluorophores defined in \code{control.def.file},
identifying variations in spectral profiles. It does this by performing SOM
clustering on the positive events in the cleaned control data. The output is
saved as an .rds file, and figures summarizing the variation are saved, if
desired. Note that the .rds file contains all the needed information for
downstream processing (per-cell unmixing), so you can just load that using
the \code{readRDS} function) rather than re-running this process.
