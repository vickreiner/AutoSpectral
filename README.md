# AutoSpectral

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

AutoSpectral is AutoSpill updated for the spectral flow era.

The goal of AutoSpectral is to provide you with the best possible
spectral signatures of the fluorophores in your single-stained controls.
Whether or not these accurately model your fully stained samples will
depend on what you’ve chosen to use for the controls, how they were
prepared and other factors such as machine condition and any divergence
in handling between samples and controls.

More to the point, AutoSpectral is intended to make working with messy
cell-based controls as easy as compensation beads. This should give you
better accuracy and precision in your spectral definition and thus in
your unmixing.

Plus, you can extract each cell’s individual autofluorescent background
in a manner specific to that cell, producing better unmixing with less
spread. Per-cell fluorescence spectral optimization can reduce unmixing
errors.

At the moment, the following cytometers are supported:

- Cytek Aurora (“aurora”)
- Cytek Northern Lights (“auroraNL”)
- Sony ID7000 (“id7000”)
- BD FACSDiscoverS8 (“s8”)
- BD FACSDiscoverA8 (“a8”)
- BD FACSymphony A5 SE (“a5se”)
- Agilent NovoCyte Opteon (“opteon”)
- Beckman Coulter CytoFLEX mosaic (“mosaic”)
- ThermoFisher Attune Xenith (“xenith”)

## Installation

[![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/stable-master-blue)](https://github.com/DrCytometer/AutoSpectral)
[![Dev](https://img.shields.io/badge/dev-branch-orange)](https://github.com/DrCytometer/AutoSpectral/tree/dev)

### Latest Release

**Version 0.8.7**

Install using `devtools` or `remotes`. You will need to install the
Bioconductor packages separately, I believe.

``` r
# Install Bioconductor packages
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
  install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install(c("flowWorkspace", "flowCore", "PeacoQC"))

# You'll need devtools or remotes to install from GitHub.
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("DrCytometer/AutoSpectral")
```

### Dev branch

You can install the development version of AutoSpectral from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("DrCytometer/AutoSpectral@dev")
```

## Bug fixes and known issues

AutoSpectral is pretty complex and newly released, so there will be
bugs. Sorry. Thanks to all of you providing feedback.

Since one of my recent updates broke things, I’ll be moving to using
tagged releases that should be easier to install if the latest version
has flaws. I’ve also set up a separate development branch, which will
get the updates first. Things probably should have been that way from
the start, but this is all new to me.

Please check the [help pages and
articles](https://drcytometer.github.io/AutoSpectral/) before submitting
bug reports. There’s a lot of info there.

In particular, see the [Full
Workflow](https://drcytometer.github.io/AutoSpectral/articles/Full_AutoSpectral_Workflow.html).

- Gating. The automated gating is not great. See the [help
  page](https://drcytometer.github.io/AutoSpectral/articles/Gating.html)
  for tips. I’m looking into an alternative.
- Please note that FCS 3.2 files from the S8 and A8 cytometers are not
  fully supported in flowCore. You may receive warnings, but things
  should still work.
- More stuff in progress will appear in the [Development
  article](https://drcytometer.github.io/AutoSpectral/articles/Development.html)

If you want to use data from another cytometer and are wiling to provide
files for establishing the workflow, contact the author/maintainer.

This work has received funding from the KU Leuven C1 program, the
European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under
grant agreement No 874707 (EXIMIOUS), Wellcome Investigator Award
222442/A/21/Z, and UKRI Proactive Vaccinology Award MR/Y004450/1
(IMMPROVE).

## Example

Below is a basic example of the workflow, using samples from the ID7000.
This only illustrates weighted least squares unmixing. For per-cell
autofluorescence extraction or per-cell fluorophore optimization, see
the articles on those topics.

Please see the [Full
Workflow](https://drcytometer.github.io/AutoSpectral/articles/Full_AutoSpectral_Workflow.html)

``` r
library( AutoSpectral )

# Define the location of the single-stained control files.
control.dir <- "./Cell controls"

# Get the parameters for your cytometer.
# Supported cytometers include "aurora", "id7000", "a8", "s8" and "opteon".
asp <- get.autospectral.param( cytometer = "id7000", figures = TRUE )

# Optionally, create a control file (see article on this).
# After creating it, manually edit to ensure it is correct.
create.control.file( control.dir, asp )

# Locate the edited control file.
control.def.file <- "fcs_control_file.csv"

# check the control file for errors
control.file.errors <- check.control.file( control.dir, control.def.file, asp )

## Adjustments to automated gating
# This will be covered more extensively elsewhere.
# in this case, the cells on scatter are very small, so we modify the target.
asp$gate.bound.density.max.target.cells <- 0

# Load the control files, gate, prepare for spectral extraction.
# This is usually the slowest step.
flow.control <- define.flow.control( control.dir, control.def.file, asp )

# For speed and accuracy, the recommended approach is to clean the controls
# using separate (universal) negative samples for both beads and cells.
# In doing so, we select cells with matching autofluorescent background and
# restrict the calculations to the brightest events.
flow.control <- clean.controls( flow.control, asp )

# Extract the clean spectra
univ.neg.spectra <- get.fluorophore.spectra( flow.control, asp,  
                                             use.clean.expr = TRUE,
                              title = "Universal Negative Cells" )

# By default AutoSpectral extracts autofluorescence as a spectrum.
# This is comparable to "Autofluorescence as a Fluorescent Tag" in SpectroFlo
# More on this later.
# To remove this AF parameter for unmixing:
no.af.spectra <- univ.neg.spectra[ ! rownames( univ.neg.spectra ) == "AF", ]

## Unmixing
# Set the location of the raw files to be unmixed.
sample.dir <- "./Raw samples"

# Perform unmixing, here we will unmix all fcs files in the folder using 
# Weighted least squares (WLS or in Sony lingo, WLSM).
unmix.folder( sample.dir, no.af.spectra, asp, flow.control, method = "WLS" )
```

## Go Faster

R is not known for its speed.

For faster processing there are three things you can do, hopefully all
fairly easy.

First, upgrade the BLAS and LAPACK libraries used by R. These provide
algorithms for linear algebra, which is the heart of spectral unmixing.

On Windows, simply swapping out your .dll files as in this tutorial can
give speed ups of 5x. [Install
OpenBLAS](https://github.com/david-cortes/R-openblas-in-windows) All
this involves is downloading the files from the internet, placing them
in the right folder and doing a quick restart.

On Mac, you likely want to use the vecLib library BLAS that ships with
Mac OS. The following articles may be helpful in setting this as the
default BLAS for use in R: [BLAS for Mac in
R](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/RMacOSX-FAQ.html#Which-BLAS-is-used-and-how-can-it-be-changed_003f)
[Performance BLAS](https://csantill.github.io/RPerformanceWBLAS/)
Feedback from users on Mac who successfully upgrade their BLAS would be
appreciated.

Do not set multiple threads for the BLAS as this will conflict with
higher level parallelization, either in AutoSpectral or other packages.

Second, install AutoSpectralRcpp. This is fully accessible from R and
integrates with AutoSpectral. But, when it gets to the slow bits in the
unmixing, it switches over to calculating in C++, so it can be 10-100x
faster.

[AutoSpectralRcpp](https://github.com/DrCytometer/AutoSpectralRcpp)

You will need [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/)
to compile this.

You can install AutoSpectralRcpp like so:

``` r
devtools::install_github("DrCytometer/AutoSpectralRcpp")
```

Third, turn on parallel processing in AutoSpectral. At the moment, this
is not fully optimized in AutoSpectral. The parallel processing in
AutoSpectralRcpp operates via OpenMP and works well. It is always
activated, but the number of threads can be configured.

To activate parallel processing, check the function arguments for a
`parallel` option and set it to `TRUE`. Additionally, there is control
over the number of threads used, which should be directly in the
function call via a `threads` argument. If you don’t know how many
threads to use, check the recommendation for your machine after running
`get.autospectral.param()`:

``` r
asp$max.worker.process.n
```

For unmixing larger data sets, you will do well to use a machine with
more CPUs. Suggestions for faster processing are welcome. Some modest
improvements are in the works.
